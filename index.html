                <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYY!!!!</h1>
                <p>Today we celebrate the heart of our family, the woman whose love has shaped our world in quiet, powerful ways. You've been our rock in storms, our loudest cheerleader in victories, and the soft place to land when life gets heavy. Your strength, grace, and boundless love are the reasons we know what home feels like. No words can fully express how much we love you — but today, and always, we celebrate the light you bring into our lives.</p>

                    <p> My spirited and loving bae
                    You captured my heart,
                    on the very first day.
                    Met many women gorgeous and smart.
                    But I never felt for anyone this way
                    Was it your dreamy eyes,
                    that touched my soul?
                    Or was it your sweet voice,
                    that makes me blissful and whole
                    I think it is all of you
                    that makes me feel the way I do!
                    Happy birthday my darling,
                    I love you

                <p class="title">From Tosin:</p>
                <p class="text">Happy birthday Mrs.Ojulari
                    We fight. You annoy me. I annoy you back — sometimes on purpose. You say things that make me roll my eyes, and I say things that make you lecture me for half an hour. But through all of it, I wouldn’t trade you for the world.
                    You’re strong, loving, and absolutely stubborn. You’ve taught me so much — not just with your words, but with the way you love fiercely, give generously, and stand tall no matter what life throws at you.
                    And yes… you might be covered in grey hair. Don’t worry — they suit you. Wisdom looks good on you (even if you still don’t know how to use apps or a computer properly).
                    On this special day, I just want to say thank you — for everything. For your endless love, your quiet strength, your patience, and all the little sacrifices you made that I never even noticed until I was older. You’ve shaped my heart, my values, and the way I see the world, simply by being you. 
                    You are my safe place, my biggest supporter, and the person whose love has never wavered, not even for a moment. I don’t say it enough, but I admire you more than words can express. I’m proud to be your child, and I hope today brings you even a fraction of the joy you’ve brought into my life.
                    I love you more than I can ever really say — even when we argue, even when I act like I don’t hear you, even when I pretend your advice is outdated. You are my heart, my safe place, and the reason I am who I am.</p>
                    <p> Happy birthday, Mum. Let’s laugh a lot today — and maybe only fight a little.</p>

                <p class="title">From Ade:</p>
                <p class="text">Happy Happy Birthday, Fine Girl!! Who would have thought that after all our numerous fights, we would still be this close - closer than anything even held by glue. It's been 19 years since we met, and while you've seen me grow and change, my feelings for you have remained constant despite all of my grumbling, complaining, and mini-tantrums. My heart still crumbles and melts when I see/hear from you; you were my first home and will always be my home. Although we don't call as frequently as you'd like, I want you to know that you're still as important to me as the very air I breathe. I may not say it enough, but I love and appreciate you more than you can everrr fathom. From the sleepless nights you've had as a result of us, to the running helter-skelter and being there for us when we needed you the most - and even when we told you your presence was annoying you still stayed; you are the true definition of a CONSTANT. You have been a role model for us and mothers all over the world, and for that we deeply appreciate you.</p>

                <p> So, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY #1 FIGHTING PARTNER!!!! I LOVE YOUUUU and hope you have a wonderful day (please no fighting, just laugh and bask in your celebration!)</p>
